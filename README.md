## Project requirements


1/ Python: A general-purpose programming language.

2/Pandas: A software library written in Python for data manipulation and analysis.

3/ NumPy: A Python library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

4/ Matplotlib: A Python plotting library and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose.

5/ Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

6/ Scikit-learn: A free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN. It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
